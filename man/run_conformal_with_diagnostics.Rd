\title{One-shot conformal example with Safe-U comparison}
\usage{
run_conformal_with_diagnostics()
}
\value{
Invisibly, a list with components \code{res_safeU} and
\code{res_conf}, the outputs of \code{\link[=adaptive_fdr_safeU]{adaptive_fdr_safeU()}} without and
with conformal tightening respectively.
}
\description{
Runs a single simulated experiment (similar to the examples used in
the development script) to compare the Safe-U-only procedure to its
conformal refinement, printing basic diagnostics to the console.
}
\details{
This helper is mainly for interactive exploration, not for use in
production analyses.
