\title{ECDF-based feature extraction for p-values}
\usage{
features_ecdf(
  pvals,
  H = c(0.02, 0.05, 0.1),
  ss_lambda0 = 0.7,
  alpha_pilot = 0.1,
  n_df = NULL,
  compute_stability = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pvals}{Numeric vector of p-values between 0 and 1.}

\item{H}{Vector of right-tail widths for computing A_h ratios.}

\item{ss_lambda0}{Start of the tail slope regression segment (default 0.7).}

\item{alpha_pilot}{Pilot BH level for early rejection statistics.}

\item{n_df}{Optional degrees-of-freedom metadata.}

\item{compute_stability}{Whether to compute subsample-based stability features.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of ECDF-based features.
}
\description{
This function computes a rich collection of features derived from the
empirical CDF (ECDF) of a vector of p-values. These features are used
by \code{scoutFDR} to model local π₀ behavior through calibrated
regression (CQR).
}
\details{
The feature set includes:
\itemize{
\item Tail mass ratios (A_h) for several right-tail intervals.
\item Storey-type estimates across multiple λ values.
\item Slopes and curvature diagnostics for ECDF near 1.
\item Early-tail enrichment features (F₀₀₁, F₀₁₀, F₀₅₀, etc.).
\item Simes, KS, and Higher Criticism (HC) summaries.
\item Log-p summaries, quantiles, uniqueness ratios.
\item Right-tail densities, enrichment ratios, pilot BH stats.
\item Optional stability diagnostics via subsampling.
