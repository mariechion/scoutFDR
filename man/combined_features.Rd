\title{Combined ECDF + optional BUM features}
\usage{
combined_features(pvals, lambda = 0.5, compute_stability = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pvals}{Numeric vector of p-values.}

\item{lambda}{Threshold for BUM feature x4.}

\item{compute_stability}{Whether to compute expensive stability features.}
}
\value{
A named list of features.
}
\description{
Extracts ECDF features and (optionally) appends BUM features.

BUM is fitted only if it converges; otherwise, only ECDF features
are returned.
}
