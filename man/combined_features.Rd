\title{Combined ECDF and BUM-based features}
\usage{
combined_features(p, lambda = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Numeric vector of p-values.}

\item{lambda}{Threshold used in some BUM-based features.}
}
\value{
A named list of features.
}
\description{
Computes ECDF-based features and, when the BUM fit converges, additional
mixture-model-based features. If the BUM fit fails, only ECDF features
are returned.
