Description: Implements the scoutFDR adaptive multiple testing framework,
    combining ECDF-based safe upper bounds with simulation-calibrated
    conformal corrections. The package provides tools for calibration-data
    generation, conditional quantile regression modelling, and benchmarking
    against classical adaptive FDR estimators.
